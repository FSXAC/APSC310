\textbf{Difference Between Adapter and Mediator}\bs
\\

Different from \textit{mediators} (section \ref{ssection:mediator}), as mediator manages the communication between two classes, essentially decouples the interaction of the two. Whereas adapter simply translates.
\bs
Consider a real life analogy, where two people who speak different languages are fighting. A mediator would be a lawyer such that the two people don't talk to each other directly. An adapter would be a translator so that the two can communicate more directly. Thus, adapter is structural. And Mediator is behavioral.

Useful in architectures such as component-entity-systems model which centers around the idea of ``\textit{composition over inheritance}" (section \ref{ssection:ecs}).
