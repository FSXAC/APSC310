The software design patterns are templated solutions to be implemented in large software projects. These patterns improve performance and maintainability of the end product by pushing computation and spacial optimizations to object-oriented-programming structures. The design patterns make the components of the software less error prone by making them more flexible and modular through acts of decoupling and mediating. These patterns also improve productivity and organization of programmers as monolithic code are broken down and decoupled into independent modules by function and composition. Video games, or video game engines are large pieces of software that require maximum optimizations. Therefore, the software design patterns is essential in programming of video game engine. However, the design patterns are to be used to solve existing problems by identifying specific symptons and applying the appropriate pattern. Usage in attempt to resolve small to non-existant issues is unproductive due to the relatively large ratio between time and effort required to implement versus benefits.
