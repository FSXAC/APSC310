\section{Conclusions}

The classic software development design pattern as described by the \textit{Gang of Four}\cite{gof} is undoubtly essential in even modern software development. In video game technology and design, the need is amplified. The need to desgin pattern is important as video games are computationally demanding, both in terms of process as well as memory. As consumers (players) push for more realistic and immersive experience, the technology becomes more complex. So it is also important to use these ``basis'' solutions to simply more complex solutions.\bs

As stated many times throughout the report, the benefits of the design patterns vary
